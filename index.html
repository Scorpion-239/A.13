                <h2>Abstract</h2>
                <p>
                    Peter works in a company that distributes products related to petrochemical compounds. One day, the manager of the company tells him about the chemical spills in the ground caused by the company and how the company covered them up. As an engineer, Peter has to follow the engineering code of ethics and tell the government about the oil spill, but he may not be able to get a promotion in the company or other companies might not hire him after the whole ordeal. Peter should tell the government because the oil spills can cause environmental damage, kills marine life, and pollute drinking water. Peter is in an ethical dilemma, and he has to decide whether to follow the code of ethics of engineering or to save his career by not telling the government. I think he should tell the government because he is a professional engineer, and he should follow the code of ethics.

                <p>
                    Peter works is a company that distributes products related to petrochemicals. He has been working in the company for several years now. The manager of the company is extremely pleased with his work of Peter. He wants to promote Peter to a corporate consulting engineering position. This promotion is extremely important for Peterâ€™s career. During a coffee break, the manager tells Peter about the loss of 10,000 gallons of raw petrochemical products into the ground due to some kind of leaking in the pipe. After stopping the leak and observing the ground, the company came to the conclusion that the chemical compounds were dissolving into the deep aquifer. There was no ground and water pollution recorded. So, the company decided to hide the spill from the government, and the management of the company did not report the spill.
The manager knows that there are plumes of those petrochemicals still underneath the company plant ground. The test of the ground showed that the chemical concentration underneath the plant within 400 feet is about zero, but Peter understands that he has to tell the government because the law requires that he tells the government of the spill. If he does not tell the government then he is breaking the code of ethics made for engineers. The manager does not want him to tell the government and if he does tell the government then he can lose his promotion or can even get fired from the job. The manager also believes that the company will have to pay a large sum of fines and fees due to the oil spill and the company could lose a huge amount of money from its actions of Peter. The company will also have to spend a large sum of money to clean the spill which will be hard to find because it happened a long time ago.
The manager tells Peter if he goes to the government and tells them about the spill incident then he will be causing problems for the company and not doing any good to his career. The ethical issue that arises from this situation is that if peter tells the government about the oil spill then he will cause damage to the reputation of his friend, but he will be following the code of ethics for engineers. On the other hand, if he tries to hide the oil spill then he is breaking the code of ethics that all engineers have to follow but he is saving the reputation of his friend. This case is important because these types of incidents happen all the time and many companies try to hide these incidents. The management of the company has violated two rules associated with the code of ethics. One of them is to be honorable, responsible, and lawful to boost the honor of the profession. The other code of ethics is to avoid deceptive acts. 
The management of the company was not honorable with their professional obligation and is lying to the government and the people by hiding the truth. The professional obligation of the company is to tell the truth to the government and also have a high standard of integrity [1]. The stakeholders in this situation did not act morally. The moral thing to do was to tell the public the truth and face the consequences of the actions. The company management chooses to hide the truth instead of telling the truth. That is the reason why this issue is extremely important to address. I decide to address it because these incidents are common occurrences and companies hide them. The company or the manager should have told the truth to the government and the people because oil spills cause severe damage to the environment, pollute drinking water, and kill marine life.
Oil spills cause significant environmental harm. If oil spills in the ocean, then it forms a layer of thin oil sheet which floats on the top of the water and can block sunlight from passing through the surface of the ocean. As a result, it causes harm to the marine environment and causes damages the entire food chain of the marine ecosystem [2].

                <p>
                    The oil spills affect the ocean in a variety of different ways. It can cover areas that are hundreds and thousands of miles, and nothing can survive beneath that layer of oil. During the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in 2010, 134 million gallons of oil were released in the Gulf of Mexico which covered about 2,100 km of the surface of the ocean. The oil company that caused this incident had to pay about 65 billion dollars in reparations to people that depend on the ocean for their livelihoods [5]. The oil has to be removed completely to restore the natural environment. It also costs a huge sum of money to remove oil from the ocean, and if the oil is not removed then it will remain there for a long period. The manager and the company did not tell the government about the spill, and it is in the ground for a long time. The safety, health, and welfare of the public are extremely important for engineers [1].  The oil will slowly sink into the drinking water which could in turn cause safety and health problems. So, the engineers broke their code of ethics.
Oil spills also kill oceanic life and reduce their population. Oil reduces the growth rate, causes erosion of the fins, and results in reproduction problems. When the oil forms a layer on the water and marine life comes on the top to breathe, they become infected by it. Seabirds are the most harmed animals by the oil spills because they get killed by the oil spills more than any other animal [3]. The biggest hazard to marine life is the reduced rate of reproduction due to oil spills which result in the lack of economic opportunities for the people leaving near the oil spilled areas and food shortages. The economic impact of the incident could cause serious problems for the government and the people. The company and the manager broke the code of ethics which says that engineers should always strive for the public interest by going against the interest of the people and the government [1]. The company chooses to serve its self-interest instead of serving the public interest. The company should still tell the truth and save any future potential damage to the marine environment.
Oil spills pollute drinking water and make them completely undrinkable. It is extremely harmful and dangerous to drink oil mixed water, and it is also extremely expensive to remove oil from the water. Water with oil in is toxic and any life that drinks toxic water gets poisoned and can even die. Boiling the water can kill the germs but it will not remove the oil that is in it. There is already a huge water shortage all around the world. If the companies keep spilling oil and then keep hiding the incident, then it will be a great problem for the governments as well as the general public all around the world. The management of the company broke one of the main codes of ethics by hiding the oil spill incident which states that a company should always take responsibility for its activities and incidents [1]. The company should have taken responsibility for its activity rather than trying to hide the truth for its benefit. If the truth comes out then it could cost them billions of dollars to clean the spill and the company would have created a reputation of hiding the truth and nobody will trust them. It would not be good for the stakeholders and the profit margins would certainly decrease.
 Some people might say that company hid the truth because there was no reason to tell the government. The oil was not going into the water underground and it was not causing any damage to the environment. So, there was nothing to worry about. If they have told the truth, it would have been extremely costly for the company to clean the spill and it would have also affected their reputation. The main reason the company should have told the government about the spill is that they have to follow the code of ethics made for them and it clearly states that the engineers should always uphold the integrity and honesty of the profession. Safety of the people is also the engineer's most important priority [1]. The company failed to uphold this code of ethics and it should be punished for it. Even if the oil is not harming the environment right now, how can the company be sure that the oil will not harm the environment in the future? The oil is slowly going underground and could cause pollution to the drinking water in the future. 
In conclusion, companies should not try to hide incidents caused by them. Hiding the problem will get the company into big problems which could cause them billions of dollars in revenue loss. If they hid them it could result in problems for the general public and the government. The company and the engineers working with the company should always be truthful to the people. The company should have told the truth even if the oil spill was not causing damage to the environment or the people. In the long term, it could be extremely dangerous for the people and the environment. Even now, the company could just tell the truth and clean the oil spilled to avoid harm in the future. To avoid a situation like this from happening in the future, the engineers working at the company should always be ready for this kind of problem and follow the code of ethics if anything like this happens.
